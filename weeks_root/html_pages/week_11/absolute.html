    <h1>This Webpage has an Absolute paragraph in it</h1>
    <p>Nothing on this page is "fixed" relative to the screen, and nothing is positioned by the creator.</p>
    <p>Just a plain old, ordinary, everyday page.</p>
    <h2>Not So Ordinary Anymore</h2>
    <h3>Where'd the paragraph go?</h3>
    <p id ="special">Now this gets more interesting. This paragraph is absolutely positioned 10px from the bottom, and 100px to the left, of the page.<br>
    It has been taken out of the "flow" of the page.<br>
    The CSS is as follows: <span>position:</span> absolue; <span>bottom:</span> 10px; <span>left:</span> 100px;
    </p>
