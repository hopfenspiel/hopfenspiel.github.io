    So what is IPA? The initials stand for <strong>India Pale Ale</strong>. It was the answer to the problem of providing beer for the British Empire in the east. 
    It was too hot to brew in India, so what was needed was a beer that could survive the gruelling six-month journey from Britain intact. 
    In the 1780s, a London brewer called Hodgson answered the call by sending out a strong, heavily hopped beer called October ale that would normally be aged like wine before drinking. 
    The beer not only survived the journey, but was found to have improved immeasurably. This was the prototype IPA; the beer gradually became paler and more refreshing to suit the Indian climate
