    <h2>The Story of Stout</h2>
    <p class="box stout">
        When most people hear the word <q>stout</q>, they think of someone short and stocky in stature. However,</br>
        there's also stout beer! When you think about it, the strength and bracing effects of a good stout</br>
        may embody the characteristics of someone of the same body type.  
    </p>
    <p class="box stout">
        Of all the types of stout in the world, there's none more famout than Guinness. Based in Dublin, Ireland,</br>
        the first dark beer brewed by Guinness was actually an accident! The brewer at the time accidentally put too much chocolate malt (a type of malted, kilned barley)</br>
        into the mash (a part of the brewing process). Although it wasn't intended, the beer proved to be a delight, and was loved so much by porters</br>
        that the style of beer - <q>Porter</q> - was named after them!</br></br>
        After porter came a darker version - a <strong>stout porter</strong> - from which the beer style of stout is born.
