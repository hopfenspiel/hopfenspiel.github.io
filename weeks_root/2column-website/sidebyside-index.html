<h1>Welcome to Philately!</h1>
<h3>Or, the Wide World of Stamp Collecting</h3>
		<h2>What is Philately?</h2>
        <p> 
            According to the American Philatelic Society<sup>&reg</sup>, Philately - i.e., <q>Stamp Collecting</q> - is defined as follows:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt><em>Philately</em></dt>
            <dd>
                ...the accumulation of material related to the payment of postage and the carriage of the mails.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            Going further, here's a little more background on the hobby:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Stamp collecting has often been called "the hobby of kings and the king of hobbies." Linn's Stamp News estimates that more than 5 million individuals in the United States collect the small pieces of paper that indicate payment of postage. Stamp collectors include individuals from all walks of life. While President Franklin Roosevelt may have been the most famous U.S. collector, other well known collectors include financial gurus Bill Gross and Warren Buffet; astronaut Henry Hartsfield; actors Gary Burghoff, James Earl Jones and Patrick Dempsey; author James Michener, explorer Jacques Cousteau; former Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova; musicians John Lennon, Freddy Mercury and Ron Wood; cartoonist Gary Trudeau; and French President Nicholas Sarkozy.
