		<h1>It's Beginning to Look a lot like Christmas!</h1>
			<p>

				Christmas stamps are beautiful and great for adding a touch of holiday cheer to any letter.

				Who doesn't love a good Christmas tree? This stamp definitely helps to herald the yule tides

		<h2>Merry Christmas Charlie Brown!</h2>

            Okay, maybe the song doesn't <em>specifically</em> mention stamps, but who doesn't enjoy a festive tune?
