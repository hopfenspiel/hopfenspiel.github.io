		<h1>Stamps come in many shapes and sizes...</h1>
			<p>
				...and quite often do not fall into any one category<br><br>
				Here are a few examples of assorted stamps:
			</p>
		<h2>The Mauritius Stamp</h2>
			<p>
				<img src="../../images/assorted_stamps/mauritius_stamp.jpg" width = "200"><br>
				This stamp was actually created by a Mauritian governor's wife for a ball held at their home and was
				never actually used in circulation.<br>
				There are not many known left in existence.
			</p>
		<h2>The Inverted Jenny</h2>
			<p>
				<img src="../../images/assorted_stamps/inverted_jenny.jpg" width = "200"><br>
				This stamp, the "Inverted Jenny", is a famous error - or, a misprinted stamp. The plane should be the other way around!
			</p>
		<h2>The Penny Black</h2>
			<p>
				<img src="../../images/assorted_stamps/penny_black.jpg" width = "200"><br>
				The Penny Black is not famous for its beauty, but because it is the first ever postage stamp!
